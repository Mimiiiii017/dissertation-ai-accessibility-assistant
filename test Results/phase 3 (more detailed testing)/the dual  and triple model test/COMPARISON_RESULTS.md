## Why T42 Beats T40

**Root Cause:** Qwen is better than GPT-OSS for accessibility concept matching

**Evidence:**
1. **Stage 1 Consensus More Precise** — Kimi (high recall) + Qwen (better precision) filters noise better than Kimi + GPT-OSS
2. **Precision Breakthrough** — 72.1% vs 69.2% (+2.9pp) tells us fewer false positives from consensus voting
3. **Recall Maintained** — 74.1% vs 73.5% (+0.6pp) shows we don't sacrifice recall for precision
4. **Stability Improved** — ±1.8pp vs ±2.4pp means qwen's behavior is more consistent across conditions

## Why T41 Failed (Triple Model Regression)

**Problem:** 3-model majority voting is TOO LENIENT

**Evidence:**
1. **Precision Collapsed** — 59.8% vs 69.2% (-9.4pp) — too many false positives accepted in Stage 1
2. **Recall Exploded** — 80.8% vs 73.5% (+7.3pp) — but didn't help F1 because precision loss was worse
3. **Stage 2 Couldn't Fix It** — Secondary review can't rescue 80% of issues if 40% are false positives

**Why it happened:**
- **2-of-3 majority voting** = "any issue 2+ models find, accept it" (very lenient)
- **T40's exact binary consensus** = "only accept if both models found same concept" (strict)
- Adding qwen to the vote didn't improve filtering—it sometimes agreed with only kimi (the high-recall model)
- Net effect: Stage 1 let through too much noise that Stage 2 couldn't clean up

**Key Learning:** More models ≠ better voting. Consensus quality matters more than consensus diversity.

## Why We Didn't Test GPT-OSS + Qwen Together

**Simple Answer:** Both are "secondary" models without kimi's high-recall strength

**Strategic Reasoning:**

1. **Kimi is the anchor** — Kimi-k2.5 established itself as excellent high-recall model (from T37 baseline)
   - Kimi's strength: Finds ~70% of issues (high recall)
   - Need a good validator/filter to work with it

2. **Testing strategy focused on: What's the best partner for kimi?**
   - T40: Test with gpt-oss (appeared to have good precision)
   - T42: Test with qwen (balanced performance)
   - Goal: Find which second model makes kimi + voting most effective

3. **GPT-OSS + Qwen would be suboptimal** because:
   - Neither has kimi's recall advantage
   - Both are "conservative" secondary models
   - Consensus voting architecture RELIES on one high-recall model (kimi)
   - Without kimi's foundational high recall, the consensus wouldn't catch enough issues
   - The voting mechanism is designed: High-Recall + Validator → Filtered results
   - Not: Validator + Validator → Conservative results

4. **Addition by Elimination:**
   - T39-T40: Established kimi is the high-recall anchor ✅
   - T41: Tested if adding 3rd model helps (no, worse) ❌
   - T42: Tested if different 2nd partner improves kimi pairing (yes, qwen better) ✅
   - T40 + T42 comparison gives us: kimi+qwen > kimi+gpt ✅
   - Therefore: No need to test gpt+qwen (both would be validators without the anchor)

**Could we have tested GPT-OSS + Qwen?** Technically yes, but it wouldn't advance the research because:
- We already know T40 (with kimi baseline) achieves 69% F1
- GPT-OSS + Qwen would likely return to baseline or worse (no high-recall anchor)
- Resources better spent on: What if we use different high-recall models? Or different Stage 2 recovery logic?

## Final Recommendation

### 🏆 Deploy with T42 Configuration

**Model Pair:** kimi-k2.5 + qwen3.5:397b  
**F1 Performance:** 70.05%  
**Precision:** 72.1%  
**Recall:** 74.1%  

**Why:**
- Best F1 across all conditions
- Highest precision (fewer false positives)
- Most consistent behavior (tightest variance)
- All metrics improve over T40 baseline

**Alternative (if qwen unavailable):** Use T40 (kimi+gpt-oss) at 69.0% F1

**Never use:** T41 (3-model voting) — empirically shown to be worse

| T41 | Multi-stage 3-model (kimi+gpt+qwen) | 66.0% | 59.8% | 80.8% | ❌ Diminishing returns |
| **T42** | **Multi-stage voting (kimi+qwen)** | **70.05%** | **72.1%** | **74.1%** | **🏆 OPTIMAL** |

**Total Improvement:** +26.55pp F1 from baseline (43.5% → 70.05%)
